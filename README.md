**Pros and Cons of TDD:**

Pros of Test-Driven Development (TDD):

- Improved Code Quality: TDD promotes clean, maintainable code.

- Early Issue Detection: Bugs are caught early, reducing later fixes.

- Enhanced Collaboration: TDD fosters communication among team members.

- Better Design: It encourages thoughtful code structure.

- Regression Testing: Ensures existing features remain functional.

Cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD):

- Learning Curve: TDD can be challenging to learn.

- Time-Consuming: Initial test writing can seem time-intensive.

- Maintenance Overhead: Tests need updates as requirements change.

- No Silver Bullet: Doesn't guarantee a bug-free application.

- Discipline Required: Developers must adhere to TDD practices.

- Testing Known Behavior: May miss unexpected issues or edge cases.

In short, TDD offers code quality, early issue detection, and better collaboration but comes with a learning curve, time overhead, and maintenance requirements. Its effectiveness depends on the project and team.
